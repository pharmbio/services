*A confidence predictor for logD using conformal regression and a support-vector machine:*
The model predicts Log D based on a support vector machine trained on data from ChEMBL version 23 comprising approximately 1.6 million compounds. The confidence interval is calculated for the confidence specified by the slider using the conformal prediction approach.
